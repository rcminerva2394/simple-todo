# My Simple Todo
This is still a work in progress.
The purpose is to practice the basics of React such as props, and hooks like useState and useEffect


## Functionalities
1) User write a new task
2) Each task will have three features:
   - Completion status
   - Edit 
   - Delete

### Areas of improvement to be considered in the future:
I would like to transform this simple todo into a much more complicated and purposeful todo app with aditional features such as:
1) The use of local storage
2) Categorizing tasks: School, Work, Home, etc.
3) Ranking the tasks based on level of importance
3) Filtering tasks that are completed and still pending
4) Time Record
   - When was the task first generated
   - The target time to complete the task
   - The actual time the task was completed
