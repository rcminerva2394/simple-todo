I created this to practice the basics of React such as props, and hooks like useState and useEffect.

## Functionalities
1) User can write a new task

2) Each task has three features:
   - Completion status
   - Edit 
   - Delete

3) Filters:
   - All Button (Showing all tasks inputted)
   - Active Button (Showing active tasks)
   - Completed Button (Showing completed tasks)
