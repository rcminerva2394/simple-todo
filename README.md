# My Simple Todo
This is still a work in progress.
The purpose is to practice the basics of React such as props, and hooks like useState and useEffect.

## Functionalities
1) User write a new task
2) Each task has three features:
   - Completion status
   - Edit 
   - Delete

#### Additional features to be added in the future
1) Summary of the data:
   - Number of the total tasks listed
   - Active Button
   - Completed Button

#### Needed Refactoring
1) Use of reusable UI: wrappers, buttons, and input
2) Error modal for unacceptable input values
